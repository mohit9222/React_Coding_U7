useState and useEffect Hooks - Diving deep

## useState()

> Never create state variables outside our component (This will throw an error: Invalid Hook - should be called inside a functional component)
> We have to create local state variables inside our functional component
> Call the useState Hook always on the top(Good practice) - Avoids inconsistency
> Never use or create a useState hook inside a if.. else, for loop, conditions, inside a function - creates inconsistency
